# Loan_Eligibility_Prediction
Predicting loan eligibility for a finance company. The loan eligibility process is a time-consuming process, so automation is required for faster and better outputs. The customer first applies for a home loan, and after that, the company validates the customer's eligibility for a loan. The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (in real-time) based on the customer details provided while filling out the form, like gender, marriage, dependents, education, self-employed, loan term, credit history, applicant income, co-applicant income, and loan amount. We built a classification model to target customers who are eligible for loan amounts.
